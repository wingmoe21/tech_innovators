            "[285.65 - 291.82]: So, it's really similar techniques used with Pixar as with Nintendo.\n",

            "[294.18 - 314.02]: Our rendering process is working as fast as possible while still looking amazing. You shouldn't be cutting corners just to get speed. It has to still look great. Hopefully one of the things we get across during this lecture series is that balancing act. You can always chuck in more fidelity, make it look greater. That's going to bring the frame rate down.\n",
            "[314.40 - 317.85]: So you've got to find ways of maintaining the visual quality.\n",
            "[318.14 - 321.12]: and also the frame rate.\n",
            "[321.26 - 327.67]: You play some of these big open world games, you go somewhere, drops down to 20 frames per second, you go, no, like that.\n",
            "[327.70 - 343.30]: And if you're in virtual reality, really you've got to be 120 frames per second, because you want this eye to be going at 60, and this eye to be going at 60. You end up in the same scene twice. So you've got to be even faster on virtual reality applications.\n",

            "[347.60 - 364.31]: Yes, so, as I say, the main thing we'll be talking about through the lecture series is how do we do that in real time? How do we turn those 3D models into a 2D image at a rate of 60 frames per second? What's going on on the hardware? We're going to talk about how the GPU...\n",
            "[364.36 - 385.43]: does this and how we as programmers harness the GPU to achieve what we want to do. So we can get fantastic images like Mario there. I'm a bit of a Nintendo fan so there will be a few pictures of Mario and Zelda throughout. I'm guessing that are mostly PC players. No, a few shaking heads. Who's a PC game player?\n",
            "[385.61 - 392.14]: Yeah, and with Hans Guur. Why do I hate PC game development as a game developer?\n",

            "[442.07 - 455.86]: They're built by from a sequence of polygons, typically triangles. So there's Mario again. We all know he's built up a mesh of triangles, the quartz here.\n",
            "[455.98 - 457.82]: Of course, just two triangles.\n",
            "[457.85 - 459.09]: Put together.\n",

            "[462.18 - 468.08]: abstract than that. The models aren't really sets of triangles, they're sets of points in space.\n",
            "[468.18 - 477.32]: And those points in space are connected together in polygon. It's usually in triangles. You can get a string of triangles to put together to make the model so item.\n",
