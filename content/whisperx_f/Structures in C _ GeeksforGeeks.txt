0.299 - 3.201:  Hello friends, today in this video we will discuss about structures.
5.402 - 6.122: So let us start.
7.283 - 12.566: In this program, we have two representations of how to declare a structure.
13.206 - 14.947: So let us see the first representation.
16.068 - 17.549: So we have a point structure.
19.049 - 27.514: Okay, the name of the structure is point and it has two variables x and y. Both of these variables are of integer type.
28.976 - 33.298:  In the last we have a p1 variable which is of type struct point.
34.539 - 41.803: Using this variable we can fetch the value or we can insert the value into point structure.
43.164 - 43.424: Okay.
44.485 - 57.412: If we will see the next representation so what we are doing again we are declaring a point structure which has two variable x and y both of these variables are of integer type.
58.314 - 87.318:  but now we are defining p1 variable inside main method so what we will do we will write the type of this variable which is struct point and then we will give the name which is p1 now using this p1 we can insert and fetch the value again let us go to the next example this example will tell you the representation of how to initialize the values of a structure okay
87.932 - 116.194:  so let us see the first one so what we have done here we have a point structure we have two variable x and y inside it which is of type integer now we are initializing it inside the structure only using zero value which will give us compiler error because we cannot initialize members inside our structure so what we will do we will see into next representation
117.469 - 146.029:  so what we have done here we have a point structure which has two variable x and y which are of type integer now in the main method we have defined a p1 variable which is of type struct point only okay and we are initializing the values 0 and 1 so this 0 will be corresponding to this x variable and this 1 will be corresponding to y variable let us go to the next example
147.219 - 156.121:  So in this example again we have a point structure which has two variables x and y both of these are of integer type.
157.162 - 164.064: Now in the main method we are defining p1 variable which is of type struct point and has the values 0 and 1.
164.824 - 175.027: So this 0 will be corresponding to x and this 1 will be corresponding to y. Now what we are doing we are initializing p1 dot x is equal to 20.
175.747 - 176.547: Now what will happen
177.119 - 203.003:  this 0 will be updated by 20 as the value ok now p1.x is 20 and p1.y is 1 so now if you will print p1.x so what it will give it will give us 20 as the value and if you will print p1.y then it will give us 1 as the value so let us go to the next program
204.11 - 211.296:  So in this program we have a different representation of initializing the members of a structure.
212.877 - 222.144: So this representation will tell you that we can initialize the members of a structure in any order in which we want.
223.085 - 223.685: So let us see.
225.026 - 226.207: We have a point structure.
227.528 - 232.072: Inside this point structure we have three variables x y and z.
233.51 - 235.611:  three of these variables are of integer type.
238.031 - 262.158: Now inside the main method we have defined a p1 variable which is of type struct point and in this p1 variable what we are doing we have written dot y is equal to zero what does it mean it means p1 dot y will be zero means this zero will be corresponding to
262.959 - 290.125:  y variable dot z is equal to 1 means this 1 will be representing to this z variable dot x is equal to 2 so this 2 will be representing x variable ok but in the last representation what we have done we have represented like this 0 1 and 2 ok so if you write like this
290.959 - 318.336:  it means x is equal to 0 y is equal to 1 and z is equal to 2 because it will take in a specific order but now we can give any order which we want ok in the next line what we have done we have defined a p2 variable which is also a struct point and inside this p2 variable we have defined p2 dot x is equal to 20 now we are printing
319.019 - 339.729:  p1.x p1.y and p1.z so p1.x will be 2 p1.y will be 0 and p1.z will be 1 and what will be p2.x p2.x will be 20 thank you friends for watching please leave us your comments
