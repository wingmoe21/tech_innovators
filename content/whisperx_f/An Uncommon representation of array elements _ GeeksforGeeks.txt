0.089 - 4.51:  Hello friends today in this video we will discuss about an uncommon representation of array elements.
4.93 - 7.971: This is very interesting concept let us carefully watch it.
11.591 - 19.933: So in this slide we have declared an array whose name is a and is of nine element size and each element is of integer type.
21.233 - 25.674: We have assumed that first element is stored at 1000 location.
27.274 - 29.775: So if we will print a value
30.216 - 58.0:  then what it will give it will give us the base address of the array which is 1000 only so if we will do star 1000 what is the meaning of it it means we want to fetch the value which is stored at the location 1000 so as we can see at 1000 location 11 is the value so it will give 11 as the result but we also know that a
58.621 - 85.929:  bracket 0 and close bracket will also give us the result 11 and the nice concept is if we will do bracket 0 bracket a it will also give us the result 11 why because both these representation form will be converted into pointer representation using compiler so finally if we will do a 0 or 0 a
87.714 - 117.465:  both these will be converted into star 1000 and star 1000 will give us the value 11 only so let us see the next point if we will do star 1000 plus 1 so what is the meaning of it it means we are incrementing a pointer so pointer is of integer type so if if we will increment the pointer then it will increment by 4 bytes
118.331 - 146.191:  okay so 1000 plus 1 will give us 1004 so star 1004 means we want to fetch the value which is stored at the location 1004 and 12 is the value so it will give us 12 as the result again a1 and 1a both these representation will be converted into star 1004 and this will give us 12 as the value now
147.139 - 149.981:  Let us see this representation into code form.
153.703 - 154.644: So this is our code.
155.704 - 157.845: Here I have declared an array of size 2.
158.026 - 165.85: Okay and on the first index I am storing 1 on the second index I am storing 2.
168.952 - 172.194: And I am printing two printf statements.
173.255 - 173.555: One is
174.517 - 190.907:  zero bracket air and one bracket air this is the nice concept again because these representation will be converted into pointer form using compiler so let us see what will be the result
205.936 - 208.257:  See the value is 1 and 2.
209.938 - 216.562: So using these representation also we are accessing the right results 1 and 2.
217.983 - 228.43: It means see compiler converts these array operations in a pointers only before accessing the array elements.
229.05 - 232.732: That's why these two forms are giving the same result.
233.032 - 233.913: But remember this.
235.274 - 255.859:  these representations are same a1 and 1a but these are not same a1 and bracket 1a so remember this point this is very important only these two representations are same not these representations remember this thank you for watching
