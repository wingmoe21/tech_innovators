In the C programming language (after 99 standard), a new keyword is introduced
known as restrict.
• restrict keyword is mainly used in pointer declarations as a type qualifier for pointers.
• It doesn't add any new functionality. It is only a way for programmer to inform about an
optimizations that compiler can make.
• When we use restrict with a pointer ptr, it tells the compiler that ptr is the only way to access the
object pointed by it and compiler doesn't need to add any additional checks.
• If a programmer uses restrict keyword and violate the above condition, result is undefined
behavior.
• restrict is not supported by C++. It is a C only keyword.Program
// C program to use restrict keyword.
#include <stdio.h>
// Note that the purpose of restrict is to
// show only syntax. It doesn't change anything
// in output (or logic). It is just a way for
// programmer to tell compiler about an
// optimization
void use(int* a, int* b, int* restrict c)
{
*a += *c;
// Since c is restrict, compiler will
// not reload value at address c in
// its assembly code. Therefore generated
// assembly code is optimized
*b += *c;
}
int main(void)
{
}
int a = 50, b = 60, c = 70;
use(&a, &b, &c);
printf("%d %d %d", a, b, c);
return 0;Ơ
