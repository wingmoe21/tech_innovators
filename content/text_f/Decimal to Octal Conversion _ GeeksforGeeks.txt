Given a decimal number as input, we need to write a program to convert the given
decimal number into equivalent octal number. i.e convert the number with base
value 10 to base value 8.
The base value of a number system determines the number of digits used to
represent a numeric value.
For example, the binary number system uses two digits 0 and 1, octal number
system uses 8 digits from 0-7 and decimal number system uses 10 digits 0-9 to
represent any numeric value.

remainder
Octal Number: 41
Algorithm
1. Store the remainder when the number
is divided by 8 in an array.
Divide the number by 8.
Repeat the above two steps until the
number is not equal to 0.
Print the array in reverse order now.
