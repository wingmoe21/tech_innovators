Page 1: The slide discusses exceptions where pointer and array accesses differ. The `sizeof` operator gives the total memory used by all elements in an array, while for a pointer, it gives the memory used by the pointer itself. The address-of operator (`&`), when used with an array, is an alias for the address of the first element (`&array[0]`). For a pointer, `&pointer` gives the pointer's address.

Page 2: This slide outlines the differences between initializing an array and a pointer with a string literal. Initializing a character array with a string literal sets the array's elements to the characters of the string and a null terminator. In contrast, initializing a pointer with a string literal sets the pointer to the address where the string literal is stored, which is typically read-only memory, making the string unchangeable. Additionally, pointer variables can be assigned new values, while array variables cannot.

Page 3: The slide displays an example using integer and character arrays and a pointer to a character. For the integer array 'int array[4]', 'sizeof(array)' would return the size of the entire array (e.g., 16 bytes if integers are 4 bytes each), while 'array', '&array', and '&array[0]' would result in the starting address of the array (e.g., 100). For the character array initialized to "abc", both 'char arr[]' and 'char *ptr' point to the starting address (e.g., 100), but attempting to assign a new value through the pointer (like '*(ptr+1)') would cause an error because it's stored in read-only memory. Assigning directly to the array name (like 'arr = 98') will also throw an error due to incompatible types.
