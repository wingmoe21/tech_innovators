Page 1: In the C programming language, as per the standard post-99, the keyword 'restrict' has been introduced. This keyword is applied mainly in the declaration of pointers as a type qualifier. Its primary purpose is not to introduce new functionality, but to inform the compiler of optimizations it can perform by considering that the 'restrict'-qualified pointer is the only reference to the memory being pointed to, allowing the compiler to avoid unnecessary checks. However, if the 'restrict' contract is broken by the programmer, the behavior of the program is undefined. It is important to note that 'restrict' is unique to C and is not supported in C++.

Page 2: The slide illustrates an example of how to use the 'restrict' keyword in a C program. The code shows a function named `use` with three pointer parameters, where the third pointer `c` is qualified with 'restrict'. Within `use`, the variable pointed to by `a` is increased by the value pointed to by `c`, and the same for the variable pointed to by `b`. Since `c` is declared with 'restrict', the compiler is informed that `c` is the sole pointer through which the pointed value can be accessed, which leads to more optimized assembly code since the compiler won't reload the value from `c` on every access. The `main` function demonstrates the use of the `use` function by passing addresses of three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The result is printed to the standard output, demonstrating that variables `a` and `b` have been modified by the value of `c` as defined in the `use` function.
