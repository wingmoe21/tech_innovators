Page1: The slide explains the use of the `realloc()` function in C programming, which allows for the resizing of dynamically allocated memory. The function prototype is `void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);`. It deallocates the old memory block pointed to by `ptr` and allocates a new block with the size specified by `size`. The contents of the new memory block are identical to the old block up to the minimum of the new and old sizes. If the memory beyond the old size is accessed, it will have indeterminate values. A crucial point to note is that `realloc()` should only be used with memory that was dynamically allocated, such as through `malloc()` or `calloc()`. If `realloc()` is used with memory not dynamically allocated, the behavior is undefined, meaning the result cannot be predicted and the program may crash or behave erratically.

Page2: This slide contains a code example in C demonstrating an incorrect use of `realloc()`. A static array `arr` of 2 integers is defined. The `realloc()` function is erroneously used to attempt to resize the array, which is not dynamically allocated. The program assigns a value to a position beyond the original array size, causing undefined behavior. This code is likely to lead to runtime errors or unexpected results because `realloc()` is not intended for use with static arrays.

Page3: The slide shows a correct usage of dynamic memory allocation and resizing in C. It creates an initial dynamic array with `malloc()`, assigns values to it, and then uses `realloc()` to resize the array to hold three integers instead of two. The new element is assigned a value, and the array is printed out. This example correctly employs `realloc()` with previously dynamically allocated memory, which is the intended use case.
