Page1: This slide introduces the basics of function definitions in programming. It outlines that a function definition consists of a return type, function name, and parameters with their types. The body of the function contains the code to be executed, and the function should return a result that matches the return type. The slide also shows how to assign the result of a function call to a variable of the return type.

Page2: The slide presents a practical example of a simple C program that includes defining and using functions. It features a function `max()` that takes two integer parameters and returns the larger of the two. The `main()` function declares two variables, `a` and `b`, calls the `max()` function with these variables, and then prints the result.

Page3: This slide illustrates the difference between call by value and call by reference in C programming. It uses two blocks of code to highlight how modifying a parameter inside a function does not affect the argument passed in call by value, while using pointers in call by reference allows the function to modify the original argument's value.
