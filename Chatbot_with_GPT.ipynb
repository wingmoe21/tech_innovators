How do we turn those 3D models into a 2D image at a rate of 60 frames per second? What's going on on the hardware? We're going to talk about how the GPU...\n",
            "[364.36 - 385.43]: does this and how we as programmers harness the GPU to achieve what we want to do. So we can get fantastic images like Mario there. I'm a bit of a Nintendo fan so there will be a few pictures of Mario and Zelda throughout. I'm guessing that are mostly PC players. No, a few shaking heads. Who's a PC game player?\n",
